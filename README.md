## Profile
I am a technical oriented Integration Specialist from Helsinki. I like working on diverse projects, with different technologies, systems and people. Also I like to constantly develop myself and learn new things, both hard and soft skills. Besides my experience in integrations, I have worked as a game developer and an Automation Mechanic in the past.

Outside working hours, I usually spend time with my kids or consume fictional entertainment.
Walking in nature is also close to my heart. If I'm lucky and have some extra time to spend, I develop my hobby game projects.

## Career Summary

**Integration Specialist** @ [Solita Oy](https://www.solita.fi/) _(2019 - Present)_ <br>
I'm creating impact that lasts by combining tech, data and human insight. So far at Solita, I’ve worked on several multi-site projects with major Nordic customers. My role in the projects has either been Integration Developer or Integration Architect. The project teams have included people from different countries, mainly Finland and Sweden. Most of the integrations I’ve worked on have related to the management of business-critical data, such as work hour logging, purchase orders and invoices, and HR data. In addition, I’ve worked on the specification and development of procedures.

Working on different customer projects has improved my understanding of different customers' background systems and business processes. When working with many independent parties and entities, managing the big picture is especially important. Communication and working at the customer interface play a significant role in the daily life of an Integration Specialist.
